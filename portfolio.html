        <h3>Asset Tracking System</h3>
        <p>
          Developed a tracking system for automobiles in the assembly plant. The
          web-based application used QR codes to track the location of assets
          that would ultimately create a fully functional automobile. The asset
          (or parts in this case) will be tracked as they movie through assembly
          lines in the manufacturing plant when their QR code is scanned at
          every station. There were two modules for this application. Engineer
          module allowed the technicians at every assembly line to scan the
          asset before initiating manufacturing. This would keep the application
          updated with latest tracking information for the admins as well as
          exact longitude and latitude of the asset. The Admin module allowed
          the plant managers to oversee the asset operation as it moved through
          the manufacturing facility to easily track and issue instruction to
          line technicians. This project provided enhanced efficiency of the
          plant and decreased the overall cost of reworking an asset or the cost
          incurred by scraped parts.
